### [Repository](https://github.com/PengyuW007/CPSC5616_Robot_Modelling.git) OR	

	gh repo clone PengyuW007/CPSC5616_Robot_Modelling

### Compile and Run
1. Whatever you run on any machine, please make sure you have matlab compiler

2. MatLab Version: R2022a

3. If you have MatLab compiler, just click run button. 
Please run MLP.m and LSTM.m these two files, which shows the results of MLP and LSTM after training.

### Documents
There are 3 files for input and output, for training convenience, I separate them into 3. Please run the third one
" Dataset_with_6 inputs and 2 Outputs.xlsx", which contains the whole dataset.
    1. Dataset_5000.xlsx: This file contains 5000 rows of data.
    
    2. Dataset_300000.xlsx:This file contains 349356 rows of data.
    
    3. Dataset_with_6 inputs and 2 Outputs.xlsx: This file contains 698710 rows of data. And this is the original file.

### Additional notes
These two files run over 698710 rows of data. Both of them take 40s to finish their running.
However, all the graphs and plots show up would take approximately **1MIN 30S**. I think it depends on 
your CPU and GPU. So, these two files would take a while to run, just **BE PATIENT**! Much appreciate for your patience!
