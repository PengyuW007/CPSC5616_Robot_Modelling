	gh repo clone PengyuW007/CPSC5616_Robot_Modelling

### Compile and Run
1. Whatever you run on any machine, please make sure you have matlab compiler

2. MatLab Version: R2022a

3. If you have MatLab compiler, just click run button. Please run MLP.m and LSTM.m 
these two files, which shows the results of MLP and LSTM after training.
Notes: These two files run over 698710 rows of data. Both of them take 40s to finish there running.
However, when all the graphs and plots show up would take approximately * **1min and half** *. I think it depends on 
your CPU and GPU. So, these two files would take a while to run, just **BE PATIENT**! Much appreciate for your patience!
